FoOlSlide 2
=========
__WARNING! THIS IS UNOFFICIAL!__

__Current stable version: 2.3.0__

FoOlSlide is a ridiculously elaborated comic reader meant for users to enjoy reading.
Sick of waiting for the official FoolSlide2? Check out this "Version 2". The update primarily focuses on bringing the design/libraries up to date and making FoOlSlide mobile-friendly. The backend theme has been updated to Bootstrap 3 (lots of code mods) and the frontend has been improved. Feel free to make your own theme.
Work on this project is not finished yet! Please report bugs and suggestions. The updater does not work yet either, so each new version needs to be downloaded manually. If upgrading from the original FoOlSlide, a full wipe is recommended. If you don't wanna do this, you can try and delete removed folders from /assets etc. It's not that hard.

Installation
------------
1.  Copy everything in the archive in a public server folder
2.  Create a database (MySQL, MSSQL, MySQLi, SQLite...)
3.  Go to http://yourdomain.com/slidefolder/install
4.  Insert database info and admin account info
5.  Done
6.  It is **very** recommended that you duplicate the default theme (/content/themes/default) folder and rename in reader_config.php, because the default theme's CSS, PHP and images will be overwritten by an update.

New in version 2
------------
-  Backend recoded in Bootstrap 3 and mobile-optimized
-  Frontend theme is mobile-optimized and jquery/javascript has been updated
-  Disqus comment support (not finished)
-  Using Font Awesome icons
